# GettingandCleaningData
Assignment Week 4 Getting and Cleaning Data

# Objective:
For week 4 assignment of Getting and Cleaning Data

Read data from the internet, unzip and create data sets wiithin R

Merge the Data into single data set

Clean data adding descriptive names etc

Create tidy data set with average of each variable for each activity and Subject

# Process:

Zip File extracts into a folder structute

Main directory copntains the Readme and Features Files

Two Sub directories exist for Test and Train data

Each Folder holds the data file X and the labels file Y

Labels files indicates which of the activities are represented in the data

The data columns are labeled by the feature file
